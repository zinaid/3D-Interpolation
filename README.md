# Rotation Interpolation
Rotation interpolation supplementary videos, Wolfram Mathematica Code and Published Papers references

# This work presents a novel method for interpolating between rotations and is based on generalization of a non-Abelian Kuramoto model using quaternions.

# Wolfram Mathematica Code:
InterpolationCurve.nb - is for creating trajectory curve on S2 from a starting quaternion to end quaternion.

InterpolationObject.nb - is for interpolating an object from a starting quaternion to end quaternion. 

InterpolationVideo.nb - is for creating video of object interpolation for better explanation of interpolation.
